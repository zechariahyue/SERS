 Abstract
	Every year millions of incoming phone calls to police dispatchers are silent because of hearing/speech disabilities or unable to speak in the current situation (NENA,2021). Silent emergency calls have always been a struggle for Police dispatchers since they cannot comprehend the victim’s message. The Silent Emergency Response System(SERS) Team aims to find a better solution to this growing problem. SERS consists of a mobile application for public users and a web application for dispatchers. The SERS website handles the sensitive data between the victims and the police dispatch, including instant messaging with a dispatcher, sending anonymous tips, and looking up and visualizing geospatial data. The impact of this can be revolutionary for the first responders of America. The web team created a single-page web application with Angular and Firebase hosting on SERS website to enable silent communication throughout the ten weeks of development.
Project Proposal
Our goal was to create a proof of concept for a silent emergency messaging system for police departments to be able to receive and send emergency messages. This product is helpful for the emergencies where you can’t speak right away and for people who are non-verbal. Our intended audience was the public as well as the police dispatchers. In an emergency where the person in danger must remain quiet, they will be able to correspond with a dispatcher via online messaging. The application allows the dispatcher to collect all the information they require to file a report and provide quick information to first responders such as the location of the victim and the nature of the emergency. The application can automatically supply the dispatcher with the victim’s name and phone number as well as current GPS location. 
The unified critical communication solution market is dominated by Everbridge, which handles mass communication between the public and government agencies such as police departments or fire departments (Everbridge, 2015). However, it mainly focuses on one-way communication, such as text alerts and reports. Thus, the 911 voice call service is inaccessible for people with auditory disabilities. At the same time, the Federal Communication Center (FCC) has developed a text-to-911 service to fill in the void, but it is only accessible in specific locations such as Kansas (Federal Communication Center,2020). The FCC is trying to promote accessible communication through video calls with sign language specialists to communicate with speech-impaired users. However, it is still in production and may take longer to implement nationwide. On the other hand, the SERS application follows ADA compliance and can establish fast and secure communication. It can be accessible to mass distribution across the nations' police departments by attaching a separate database. Therefore, the SERS application that provides real-time communication has a huge potential to provide accessibility for speech-impaired users.
